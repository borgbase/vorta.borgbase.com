# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why the name "Vorta"?

[Vorta](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Vorta) are a race referenced in Star Trek. After dying they are replaced by their cloned backup. Just like your data.

### Can I use Vorta on Windows?

Borg, the underlying library we use doesn't work directly with Windows, but works on Windows 10 WSL 1 and 2. See [this Github issue](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/4466) for details.

Vorta is based on Qt, which also works on Windows. Get in touch if you have a working setup on Windows.

### Can I migrate my profiles and settings to a new installation of Vorta?

Yes. You can find your settings in:

- `~/.var/app/com.borgbase.Vorta/data/Vorta/settings.db` if you use flatpak
- `~/.local/share/Vorta/settings.db` if you use pip
- `~/Library/Application Support/Vorta` if you use MacOS

Copy that file to the same location on the new installtion.

We are working on a way to do this via the GUI -- check [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/issues/462) for details.

### My file/folder dialog looks different than other Linux programs.

If your file/folder dialog looks different compared to other linux programs then you need to install [qt5-styleplugins](https://repology.org/project/qt5-styleplugins/versions), and set `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE` to `gtk2`. See [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Uniform_look_for_Qt_and_GTK_applications) for more
